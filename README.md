# Java-GUI-Application

The objective of this is to write a Java  GUI application with which a travel agent could present options for travel destinations to a client who wants to redeem his or her accumulated frequent flyer miles. Assuming all trips depart from O'Hare International Airport and that the miles represented are for a roundtrip ticket. This is how the output looks.
